DemoProject

This project has been developed so that admin users can create building configurations. The user registers from the registration screen and logs into the site from the login screen.

Made with ASP.NET Core MVC technology.

All my JS codes are in "/wwwroot/js/site.js" directory.

Admin users are in the MySQL database.
Building configuration records are kept with MongoDB.
